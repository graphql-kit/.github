# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security concerns that impact repos under the [`graphql-kit` GitHub org](https://github.com/IvanGoncharov/) via [ivan.goncharov.ua@gmail.com](mailto:ivan.goncharov.ua@gmail.com).

My goal is to provide complete, accurate, and actionable disclosures once a reported issue has been sufficiently understood and there has been a reasonable opportunity to deploy fixes.

Please note that I am working on those project in my free time, so please be patient.
