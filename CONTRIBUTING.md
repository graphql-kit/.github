# Contributing guide

We would love for you to contribute to this repo and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep this project open and inclusive. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct.

## Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.  
For open discussions, we encourage you to use the Github Discussions channels.

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the project, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.
Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by submitting an issue.

If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work **FIRST**, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
  discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
  and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search the repo for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
1. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   Discussing the design up front helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.
